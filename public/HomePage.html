                Love Letter Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck. The game features simple rules that create dynamic and fun player interactions. Players attempt to deliver their love letter into the Princess’s hands while keeping other players’ letters
                away. Powerful cards lead to early gains but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long and your letter may be tossed in the fire!
